Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:With the increase in the number of repetitions, the chance of countries that have not had a chance increases because they compete more often than in the standard mode



Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:After 1000 simulations
