sort1 uses:Bubble sort
How do you know?:It is obvious that the maximum time can be obtained in random numbers,now in sort 1 we can see that the time number (I measured 3 times) is very high compared to other sorts,in the most difficult conditions when we have 50,000 random numbers,the time rate is about  9.400 , which is more than other sorts.




sort2 uses:Merge Sort
How do you know?:It is clear that the maximum time can be obtained in random numbers,now in sort 2 we see that the time rate (I measured 2 times) is much less than other types,in the most difficult condition when we have 50000 random numbers,the time rate is about 2.200 which is less than other types.





sort3 uses:Selection sort
How do you know?:It is clear that the maximum time can be obtained in random numbers,Now in sort 3 we see that the speed of time (I measured 3 times) is more than sort 2 and less than sort 3.In the most difficult situation when we have 50,000 random numbers,The time rate is about 5.800, which is higher than Sort 1 and lower than Sort 2.
